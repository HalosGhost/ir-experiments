LLVM IR
=======

This repository is just a place where I shall keep some small experiments as I learn to code in pure LLVM Intermediate Representation.
As this repo is meant to be a way for me to learn the ropes, PRs adding examples will likely not be accepted; however, issues highlighting flaws with my exercises or suggesting improvements will definitely be reviewed and addressed!

To Do

* Basic ``echo`` command
